# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Project
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on the classification of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. 
The project leverages the TensorFlow framework to train a neural network model capable of accurately identifying digits from 0 to 9. 

## Data Source
The project utilizes the MNIST dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle at the following URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset/data

## Project Overview
The core of the project is to learn on how to build and train a neural network using TensorFlow. 
The model is trained on the MNIST dataset to learn the distinct features of each digit, enabling it to accurately classify unseen images.
The Jupyter Notebook included in this repository provides a detailed walkthrough of the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics.

## Data Acquisition and Preparation: 
To replicate the project results, it is necessary to download the MNIST dataset from the specified Kaggle URL. The downloaded archive should then be extracted using a suitable tool such as WinRAR, 7-Zip, or the built-in file extractor in Windows.
Ensure that the extracted data files are placed in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook for data loading and processing.

## Note: 
The project code assumes that the required data files are present in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook. Please follow the instructions above to acquire and prepare the data accordingly.
